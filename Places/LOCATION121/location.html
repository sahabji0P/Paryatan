                    <p>The Lotus Temple, located in New Delhi, India, is a Baháʼí House of Worship that was dedicated in December 1986. Notable for its lotus-like shape, it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Bahá’í Houses of Worship, the Lotus Temple is open to all, regardless of religion or any other qualification.The architect of the Lotus Temple was an Iranian, Fariborz Sahba who now lives in La Jolla, California,[6] after spending some years in Canada.[7] He was approached in 1976 to design the Lotus Temple and later oversaw its construction. The structural design was undertaken by the UK firm Flint and Neill over the course of 18 months,[8] and the construction was done by ECC Construction Group of Larsen & Toubro Limited[9][dead link] at a cost of $10.56 million.
                        [10][11] The major part of the funds needed to buy this land was donated by Ardishír Rustampúr of Hyderabad, Sindh (Pakistan), whose will dictated that his entire life savings would go toward the building of the temple.</p>
